overview: >
  Lecture: Introduction to Dark Matter makes the foundation for understanding dark matter research. <br><br>

  Session 1: Dark Matter Introduction <br>
  First time begins with the motivations for dark matter and a review of the key observational evidence. Next, we will develop the thermal freeze-out framework for relic density, and conclude on why WIMP was central to this field before moving away. <br><br>

  Session 2: Indirect Detection <br>
  We then talk how dark matter could reveal itself through annihilation or decay products across the universe. Topics include signal sources, J-factors, and the latest constraints and interpretations, with emphasis on linking theory to data while accounting for backgrounds and systematics <br><br>

  Session 3: Direct Detection <br>
  This session aims to provide basic knowledge on direct dark matter detection. In addition, we will briefly introduce Light Dark Matter, which has been a subject of active research in direct detection, and discuss how the features of direct detection depend on the dark matter mass.
